### Lessons Learned
* There was a learning curve to implementing the front end. The result is worthwhile,
but there was a lot of effort expended to making the front end work. This required
forgoing some functionality that the team would have liked to include.
* Design decisions need to be finalized early.
* A buffer needs to be built into the timeframe to accommodate fixing outstanding
issues. Our team ran into some time pressure due to making certain functions work in
an ideal manner due to needing to revisit some basic functions and make them work.
