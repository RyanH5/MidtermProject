### Midterm Group Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview
Tripping is a travel app that allows the user to view travel sites in Colorado, along
with associated activities and events for different sites. Sites can be displayed with
amenities and a google maps location.

A visitor can browse to destinations, activities and events. Destinations include points of interest, 
and points of interest have a map location, business address, phone number and associated
amenities.

The user can create an account and add destinations, events and points of interest to a travel journal 
which is associated with their profile. The user can also delete or update their entries.

An administrator can make a user account inactive and perform additional functions.

### Technologies used
* Spring MVC
* JPA/Hibernate/JPQL
* Mysql
* Paperkit
* bootstrap
* Entities Grid
* CSS
* Github

### How to Use
* Login info

### Lessons Learned
* There was a learning curve to implementing the front end. The result is worthwhile,
but there was a lot of effort expended to making the front end work. This required
forgoing some functionality that the team would have liked to include.
* Design decisions need to be finalized early. Late decisions and changes added some
pressure to getting features implemented.
* A buffer needs to be built into the timeframe to accommodate fixing outstanding
issues. There was pressure to fix features that needed to be included.
