### Overview
Tripping is a travel app that allows the user to view travel sites in Colorado, along
with associated activities and events for different sites. Sites can be displayed with
amenities and a google maps location.

A visitor can browse to locations, activities and events.

The user can create an account destinations and events to a travel journal which
is associated with their profile. The user can also delete or update their entries.

An administrator can make a user account inactive.

### Technologies used
* Spring MVC
* JPA/Hibernate/JPQL
* Mysql
* Paperkit
* bootstrap
* Entities Grid
* CSS
* Github

### How to Use
* Login info

### Lessons Learned
* There was a learning curve to implementing the front end. The result is worthwhile,
but there was a lot of effort expended to making the front end work. This required
forgoing some functionality that the team would have liked to include.
* Design decisions need to be finalized early. Late decisions and changes added some
pressure to getting features implemented.
* A buffer needs to be built into the timeframe to accommodate fixing outstanding
issues. It would have been helpful to have additional time for working on look and
feel rather than fixing features that needed to be included.
